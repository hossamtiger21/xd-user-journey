# User Journey generator for Adobe XD
XD plugin to create initial layout of user journey from a CSV file
This plugin loads in user journey text from a CSV file and renders the different journey stages

## Usage

2. Add an artboard and run the plugin from "Plugins > User Journey" or use the shortcut (ctrl + shft + U).

4. If the journey extends beyond the boundaires of the artboard, remember to [resize it](https://github.com/littlebusters/Resize-Artboard-to-Fit-Contents).

## Data
The CSV should be arranged in the following way (see [sample CSV](data/serviceuser.csv) for details):
The first column is the row title, with entries in the following cells for that topic

* Row 1: Persona
* Row 2: Roles
* Row 3: Goals
* Row 4: Needs
* Row 5: Expectations

This data is used to populate the side-bar of the diagram

Rows 6-11 are for the actual steps along the journey:

* Row 6: Tasks
* Row 7: Persona
* Row 8: Emotion
* Row 9: Touch points
* Row 10: Pain points

It is intended that common graphics are used for the personas, with multiple artboards used for each persona in the service.
